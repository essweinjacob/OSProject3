HOW TO RUN
	1. Type "make" to compile code
	2. Type "./randInts" to run the random number generator
		You will be asked to input a number greater then 2, no error checking to see if the number is base 2, just dont be rude
	3. Type "./master". Program will run
	4. Check "adder_log" to verify

OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS
	None
	sleep() statements not added because they would cause the 100 second threshold to be met at 64 miniumum

PROBLEMS OVERCOME
	Fork bombing
	Undering standing the math behind all of this
	Implementation of semaphores

COMPARISON OF ALGORTIHMS
	The second computation is faster due to the fewer loops and thus less additions occuring.
